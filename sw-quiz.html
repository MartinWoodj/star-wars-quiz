<!--

The minimum requirements are as follows:

The app must lead the user through a set of questions. The user should only see one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered the current one.

Users should be able to input their answer to each question, with radio buttons or some other appropriate interface.
When the user answers the last question, the app should show his or her overall score.

Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll probably want to store your list of questions in an array.

If you are feeling particularly ambitious, consider implementing the following features:

Let the user know where in the quiz they are at each step (i.e. “Question 3 of 5")

Let the user know their score so far

Let the user know if their previous response was correct
